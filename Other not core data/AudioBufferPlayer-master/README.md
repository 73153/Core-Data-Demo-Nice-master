# AudioBufferPlayer

Demo project that shows how to do simple sound synthesis using Audio Queues. The `MHAudioBufferPlayer` class takes care of setting up the Audio Session and managing the Audio Queue. Your code only has to implement a delegate to fill up the audio buffers with the synthesized sound.
